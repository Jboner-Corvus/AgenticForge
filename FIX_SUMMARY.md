# AgenticForge Integration Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Browser Dependencies for Playwright and Puppeteer
- **Problem**: Missing browser dependencies causing web search and navigation tools to fail
- **Solution**: 
  - Installed Playwright dependencies: `sudo npx playwright install-deps`
  - Installed Playwright browsers: `npx playwright install`
  - Installed Puppeteer browsers: `npx puppeteer browsers install chrome`

### 2. Worker Service Connectivity
- **Problem**: Worker couldn't connect to PostgreSQL and Redis services when running on host
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `.env` file to use `localhost` instead of Docker service names (`postgres` and `redis`)
  - Restarted worker with correct configuration

### 3. Worker Process Management
- **Problem**: Worker process wasn't running with correct environment
- **Solution**:
  - Properly started worker with `NODE_ENV=development` flag
  - Ensured worker is running in background with proper logging

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Fixed
- Browser tools (webSearch, webNavigate, browser) now work correctly
- Worker can connect to PostgreSQL and Redis services
- Basic functionality is working (canvas display, todo lists, etc.)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Working
- Integration tests still have issues:
  - Race conditions with ES modules loading
  - Mock function problems in tests
  - Logger module import issues

### üìù Recommendations

1. For development on host:
   - Use the localhost configuration in `.env` file
   - Ensure worker is running before running tests

2. For production/Docker deployment:
   - Keep the original Docker service names in `.env` file
   - Run everything through Docker Compose

3. For testing:
   - The canvas and todo list functionality works correctly
   - Focus on fixing the specific test issues identified in the logs
