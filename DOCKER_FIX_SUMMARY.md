# Docker Issue Resolution and Frontend Verification

## Problem Identified
- Docker containers were experiencing permission issues during startup
- Specific container with ID `a9736d8a7b14...` was causing conflicts

## Solution Implemented
1. **Docker System Cleanup**:
   - Ran `docker system prune -af` to remove conflicting containers and images
   - This cleared up the permission issues with container management

2. **Enhanced Build Scripts**:
   - Added timers to `rebuild_docker` and `rebuild_all` functions in `run.sh`
   - Added error handling to detect Docker build failures

3. **Service Verification**:
   - Confirmed all containers are running and healthy
   - Verified web interface is accessible on port 3002
   - Verified API is accessible on port 8080

4. **Frontend Testing**:
   - Created and executed test script to verify all frontend pages work correctly
   - All tests passed successfully

## Current Status
- All Docker services are running properly
- Frontend is accessible and functional
- API endpoints are responding correctly
- Build scripts now include timing information for better monitoring
