# README Standardization Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design for standardizing README files across the AgenticForge project. The goal is to ensure consistency, completeness, and accuracy of documentation across all language versions.

## Current State Analysis

### Main README.md (French)

- Contains detailed installation instructions, configuration guides, and usage examples
- Includes all features and functionalities of AgenticForge
- Well-structured with proper sections and formatting
- Contains project-specific information like "G-Forge" naming
- Includes comprehensive usage examples and demos
- Contains detailed configuration guides
- Has extensive troubleshooting section

### Language-specific README files (English, Spanish, Chinese, etc.)
- Incomplete and outdated compared to the main README
- Missing critical sections like installation, configuration, and usage guides
- Inconsistent formatting and structure
- Some files are significantly shorter than the main README
- Contain outdated project naming ("G-Forge" vs "AgenticForge")
- Missing important features and capabilities documentation
- Some files lack comprehensive installation instructions
