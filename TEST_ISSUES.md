# Test Issues Summary

## Current Status
- ✅ Linting: Passing
- ✅ Type Checking: Passing
- ❌ Unit Tests: Failing

## Issues

### 1. Core Package Test Failure
**File**: `packages/core/src/webServer.test.ts`
**Test**: "should return 200 for GET /api/tools"
**Issue**: The test expects a 200 status code but receives a 500 status code for GET requests to `/api/tools`.
**Action**: Investigate why the `/api/tools` endpoint is returning a 500 error and fix the underlying issue.

### 2. UI Package Test Failures

#### a. useConnection Hook Tests
**File**: `packages/ui/src/lib/hooks/__tests__/useConnection.test.tsx`
**Issues**: 
- Multiple tests failing due to accessing properties on null or undefined objects
- Tests expecting mock functions to be called with specific arguments but they're not being called
**Action**: Fix the test setup and mocks to properly initialize the required objects and ensure the mock functions are called correctly.

#### b. Component Rendering Issues
**Files**: 
- `packages/ui/src/components/UserInput.test.tsx`
- `packages/ui/src/components/ControlPanel.test.tsx`
- Other component test files
**Issue**: Components are not rendering properly in tests. The test environment only shows an empty div instead of the rendered components.
**Likely Cause**: Compatibility issue with React 19 and the testing environment (jsdom, testing-library).
**Action**: 
- Investigate React 19 compatibility with the current testing setup
- Consider updating testing-library versions or downgrading React if necessary
- This is a more complex issue that may require significant changes to the testing environment

## Next Steps
1. Fix the core package test by investigating the `/api/tools` endpoint issue
2. Fix the useConnection hook tests by correcting the mock setup
3. Investigate and address the React 19 compatibility issue with component rendering in tests
